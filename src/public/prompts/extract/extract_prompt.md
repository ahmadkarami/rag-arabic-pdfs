You're looking at a scanned PDF page. Your task is to extract all content and convert it into clean, readable Markdown format.

        Follow these instructions precisely:

        If the page contains text:
            •	Extract the text exactly as it appears.
            •	Maintain correct structure, headings, spacing, and line breaks.
            •	Use clean Markdown formatting (e.g. bold, headings, bullet points) to improve readability without altering the original meaning.

        If the page contains an image (diagram, chart, stamp, signature, logo, etc.):
            •	Insert a detailed Markdown image description in place of the image.
            •	Describe the image in the original language of the document (e.g., Arabic if the document is in Arabic).
            •	Be accurate and thorough — mention layout, labels, stamps, handwriting, icons, seals, signatures, etc.

        Maintain the original order of all elements:

        If the PDF has:
        text → image → text
        Your Markdown should follow the same sequence.

        Do not skip any part — extract everything from the page as if you're recreating the document in Markdown, but more readable.
